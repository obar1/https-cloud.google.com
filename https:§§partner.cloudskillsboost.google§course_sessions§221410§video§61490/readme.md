![](2022-03-28-17-39-10.png)
dwh csonsolidates many source
the diff with datalake is consolidate as we defined schemas
datalake is just raw data
raw data to be kept around is for datalake
query need to be quick in dwh

a moderm dwh 
- dataset dorn fit in mem
- single dwh that can scale 
- serverless and nops (no idx and maintance)
- support rich visualization 
- need to build datapipelines to bring data in dwh
- able to stream data too - not only batch
- support predictive ml inside
- support strong security and share data easily
