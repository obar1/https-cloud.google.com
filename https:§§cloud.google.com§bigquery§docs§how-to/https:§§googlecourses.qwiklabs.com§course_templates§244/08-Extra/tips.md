Hello there.
Here are my feelings right after exam:


	
	I didn't have any issues with the corporate laptop during the exam.
	
	
	Pay extra attention when you create your Biometric Profile before the exam. I did my profile with glasses incidentally while was trying to fix the Kryterion issue. Therefore the software was unable to detect me on cam ("face not recognized") before the exam until I used glasses.
	
	
	
	After face detection, you will be asked to show your ID, room with all walls, and laptop without any cables. Since this is a manual procedure it needs to wait some time for the operator. I have to say that it's quite inconvenient to demonstrate your room and laptop when you have internal cam: the operator asked me to take a picture of my laptop using a mobile phone and then asked to show how I place ID and mobile into another room.
	
	
	
	
	The test timer will start only after the procedure from the previous point, but it's better anyway to be prepared in advance.
	
	
	
	
	On the exam, you can see the number of required answers. For me most of them had just a single option, around 10 questions had 2 possible choices (50 questions in total).
	
	


 
I have used these resources as materials:


	
Our slides and videos (very useful to look on artifacts not only for Data Engineer but for DevOps and Architect as well).
	Professional Data Engineer Study Guide.
	Google Machine Learning Crash Course.
	Very useful comment see above from Liliya Smola. Thank you! I would highly recommend learning completely Google Machine Learning Crash Course as a preparation for the exam:https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course

Hi colleagues. Looks like I passed the exam. Below is a couple of recomendations.
Multi-regional storage has a 99.95 percent availability SLA. Regional storage has a 99.9 percent availability SLA. Nearline and Coldline storage have 99.9 percent availability SLA in multi-regional locations and 99.0 percent availability in regional locations.

    Hi everyone. Looks I've passed my exam too, need just to wait for evaluation)
Thanks everyone who shared their experience and useful links. I will add some more from my side too:



	
https://www.examtopics.com/exams/google/professional-data-engineer/view/1/ - Lots of exam questions but first ~35 pages with possible incorrect answers so always look at "Discussion" tab to check if answer is valid (Some very similar questions was on my exam so read very carefully)
	https://github.com/ml874/Data-Engineering-on-GCP-Cheatsheet/blob/master/data_engineering_on_GCP.pdf - Nice one cheat sheet to review essentials before the exam
	https://www.slideshare.net/GuangXu5/gcp-data-engineer-cheatsheet - One more nice cheat sheet , even better that previous one, also got some details that were useful but weren`t mentioned in the book or in the Quicklabs videos
	GCP official documentation also is good to review

Thanks a lot to Szymon Chojnacki, Alexander Svyatov and Andrei Agafonov for their video sessions and interactive tests. And also thanks to all the organization team for this course and their help with solving problems)
