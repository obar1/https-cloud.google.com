https://linuxacademy.com/course/google-cloud-data-engineer/
• Linux Academy

They can help you pass the exam, but most likely you will forget material after a month or two. 

## Community resources
There are many blogs and pages with good .  It is generally beneficial to study these materials and be critical.
